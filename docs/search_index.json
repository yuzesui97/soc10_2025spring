This hands-on course explores the promises and pitfalls of leveraging “big data” and algorithms to understand modern social and economic systems. Each week, we will examine key sociological topics such as inequality, discrimination, and polarization through the lens of computational methods, as well as delve into cutting-edge techniques in computational social science. The course culminates in a group research project that will equip you with skills ranging from designing and executing large-scale surveys and experiments to fitting machine learning models and analyzing diverse data types like social networks and natural language. No prior statistical or programming experience is required. This website is the place where you can find R progamming lab notes for the course. "],["intro-to-r.html", "Week 1 Intro to R 1.1 R Basics", " Week 1 Intro to R This section is drafted based on Dr. Mark Hoffman’s previous SOC 10 lab notes. 1.1 R Basics This initial tutorial for R has two primary learning objectives. The first is to become affiliated with the R environment and the second is to learn how to extend the basic set of R functions to make it suitable for your own research purposes. The lessons we learn in this tutorial will serve as a strong basis for the those that follow, which focus on the actual analysis of data using R. Like most programming languages, R can serve as a calculator. We will use many of these basic mathematical operations when working with data. 2 + 2 return: [1] 4 "],["404.html", "Page not found", " Page not found The page you requested cannot be found (perhaps it was moved or renamed).
