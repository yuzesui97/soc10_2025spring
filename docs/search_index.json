This hands-on course explores the promises and pitfalls of leveraging “big data” and algorithms to understand modern social and economic systems. Each week, we will examine key sociological topics such as inequality, discrimination, and polarization through the lens of computational methods, as well as delve into cutting-edge techniques in computational social science. The course culminates in a group research project that will equip you with skills ranging from designing and executing large-scale surveys and experiments to fitting machine learning models and analyzing diverse data types like social networks and natural language. No prior statistical or programming experience is required. Welcome to this additional resource site! In addition to Canvas, you’ll find lecture slides and lab notes here. This site is designed to help you build the coding skills required for the course, featuring all the code examples covered in the labs.
