# Surveys and Survey Experiments with Qualtrics

*This section is drafted based on Dr. Mark Hoffman's previous SOC 10 lab notes.*

## Overview

In this week, we will go from using data that someone else collected to collecting data of our own using Qualtrics. Qualtrics makes collecting survey data online easy. If you have ever used something like Google Forms, it is, in many respects, quite similar, except that it is much more powerful. As you will see, we can quickly and easily build a survey experiment, administer the experiment, download the results, and import them into R. Let’s get started!

## Creating a Qualtrics account

Stanford is kind enough to provide all of us with access to Qualtrics. [Click here to get started](https://uit.stanford.edu/service/survey).
